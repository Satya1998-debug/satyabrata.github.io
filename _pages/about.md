Hey there, Thanks for Stopping by!!  
  

👋 ***About Me***  


I’m Satya, and I build things that think, move, and talk back (sometimes even better than humans 😄).
I’m a master’s student at the University of Stuttgart, working at the crossroads of robotics, AI, automation, and software development. Whether it’s making robots walk, see, or chat — I love giving machines a touch of intelligence and a hint of personality.

🧠 ***What I'm Up To***  

Currently, I’m wrinting my Master Thesis.  


On the *Robotics* side, its Master Thesis, where I'm Training a RobotDog (yes, the cool quadruped kind!) to navigate indoors and traverse doors — focusing on Human-Robot collaboration. I’m integrating camera perception and speech interfaces using large language models (LLMs), enabling the robot to understand instructions and communicate back through natural speech. It’s a step toward making robots more intuitive and collaborative in shared environments. Think of it as a friendly indoor sidekick that can walk, watch, and chat!


🔧 ***My Playground Includes...***  

**Languages**: Python, C, Julia, C++

**Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, ROS, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Scipy, Matplotlib, Plotly, Streamlit

**Tools**: Docker, Git, Conda, Jupyter, Linux, MATLAB, Simulink, CI/CD

**Technologies**: Agile, Automotic Radar, Autonomous Driving, Robotics

  



🗺️ ***Life Outside the Lab...***  

My journey has taken me across **continents** and **cultures**:  

🗾 I spent an exchange semester in Japan, soaking up AI, sushi, fireworks, and the beauty of Mt. Fuji

🇮🇹 This summer, I’ll be heading to the Ferienakademie in Sarntal, Italy — a highly selective program organized by TUM, FAU, and Uni Stuttgart in collaboration with Siemens Healthineers, where top students come together to explore big ideas and eat pasta under the Alps
  

🏆 ***Highlights...***  

🛠️ Built robotic arms for automated driver testing.  

🚗 Developed optimization algorithms for sustainable fan mobility (and won awards for it!)  

🤖 Constantly tinkering with ideas that bring real-world intelligence to life  


🧘‍♂️ ***When I'm Not Coding...***  

I’m probably hiking through forests, sketching on a quiet bench, or trying to find the best viewpoint in a new city. I love cultures, languages, and that feeling of being lost (in the good way).  


***If you're building something wild with robots, AI, LLMs, or automation — let’s connect! I’m always up for a great conversation or a crazy collaboration.***
